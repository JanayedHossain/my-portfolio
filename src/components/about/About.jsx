            About Me
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I'm a passionate frontend developer who enjoys building clean,
            user-friendly websites and applications. My journey in programming
            started during university, and it quickly turned into a long-term
            passion.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I specialize in React, JavaScript, and modern frontend tools. I love
            solving problems and turning ideas into real products that work
            smoothly in the browser.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, reading science fiction, and
            experimenting with new recipes. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and
            improve both personally and professionally.
